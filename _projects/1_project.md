Membrane identity in eukaryotic cells is defined by the phosphoinositide family of phospholipids, with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P₂] serving as the key signaling lipid that resides on and defines the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). There, PI(4,5)P₂ plays indispensable roles such as intracellular transport and morphogenesis. Despite PI(4,5)P₂'s central role, how its precursor PI(4)P drives its dynamics remains unclear. In this paper, we found that PM PI(4)P, previously regarded as a static pool, can also exist as periodic oscillations. We then showed that the rate of PM PI(4)P synthesis is critical for maintaining PM PI(4,5)P₂ oscillations. The wave nature of phosphoinositides highlights the need to understand cellular membranes in a broader dynamical regime.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
