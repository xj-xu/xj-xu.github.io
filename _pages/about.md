**oscillations, non-equilibrium physics, <br/> and whatever it is that makes life tick.**

I'm fascinated by all kinds of patterns in nature<br/>
from sand ripples, chemical oscillations, <br/>
to stripes and waves on lipid membranes.

You feel a kick when,<br/>
you see the lipids dance in sync.
<!-- You feel alright when,
you see the pattern curve and blink. -->

I'm in the final year of the PhD,<br/>
and as my friends would say,<br/>
itâ€™s time to quit being a rookie and boogie.
